Built with React, Redux, Node, Express, PostgreSQL. Utilizes the pixabay.com API to generate public domain photos. Deployed on Heroku to lasercomet.com with an SSL certificate. To build this React application I taught myself Redux and incorporated it to handle the state for my application.

###Usage

Find. Gather. Share. LaserComet is a place for people to curate photo albums without the need of a camera. A user can search and save photos to build their own album. It is also a great place to explore albums and share with other users what you have made.
